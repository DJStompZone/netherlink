    <b>Netherlink</b> is a web application for planning setup of <a
    href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Nether_portal"
    target="_blank">Nether portals</a> in Minecraft. It lets you
    record a set of portals in your world, and simulates connections
    between them. The app tells you what will happen if you create a
    portal at a certain place.

    If your browser supports <abbr title="Progressive Web
    Application">PWA</abbr>, you can also install Netherlink to your
    device and use it as if it were a regular application, even
    without a network connection.
