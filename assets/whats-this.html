    <b>Netherlink</b> is a web application for planning setup of <a
    href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Nether_portal"
    target="_blank">Nether portals</a> in Minecraft. It lets you
    record a set of portals in your world, and simulates connections
    between them. The app tells you what will happen if you create a
    portal at a certain place.

    The app has only been tested on Firefox, Safari (Mac), and Safari
    (iOS) and can be buggy on other browsers. Fork it on <a
    href="https://github.com/depressed-pho/netherlink">GitHub</a> if
    you can suggest any changes to the app. Patches are welcomed.

    web apps</a>, you can also install Netherlink to your device and
    use it as if it were a regular application, even without a network
    connection.
