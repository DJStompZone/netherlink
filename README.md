# What's this

**Netherlink** is a web application for planning setup of [Nether
portals]( https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Nether_portal) in
Minecraft. It lets you record a set of portals in your world, and
simulates connections between them. The app tells you what will happen
if you create a portal at a certain place.

The application is hosted here:

Any changes you make are automatically saved in your browser, **and
only your browser**. If you want to share your data between browsers,
you need to export your world data to a file, and import it in another
browser.

If your browser supports [progressive web
apps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps),
you can also install Netherlink to your device and use it as if it
were a regular application, even without a network connection.
